# NLP Chatbot

An AI chatbot that manages calendar events, answers questions, tells jokes, and engages in natural conversation using core NLP techniques.

---

## Overview

This chatbot was developed using traditional NLP techniques including tokenisation, stemming, TF-IDF vectorisation, and logistic regression. It can classify user intents, personalise responses, and interface with calendar data for practical scheduling support.

---

## Introduction

The chatbot focuses on:

- Handling university calendar-related queries
- Answering general Q&A
- Maintaining basic conversational flow
- Tracking context and user identity

## Architecture

> **Diagram**: Shows NLP pipeline ‚Üí intent matcher ‚Üí calendar parser ‚Üí context manager ‚Üí response generator

**Core Components:**

- **Preprocessing:** Tokenisation, stemming, stop word removal, and lowercasing
- **Intent Matching:** TF-IDF vectorisation (unigrams/bigrams, top 5000 features) and cosine similarity
- **Calendar Access:** Parses iCal files, extracts events by type and date
- **Context Tracking:** Maintains conversational thread for follow-up questions
- **Identity Management:** Stores user names to personalise dialogue

---

## Conversational Design

- **Prompt Design:** Friendly and helpful system prompts
- **Discoverability:** Explains capabilities on request
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback messages
- **Personalisation:** Remembers and uses user names
- **Context Awareness:** Handles multi-turn dialogue about calendar events

---

## Evaluation

- **Early-stage Testing:** Wizard-of-Oz study to collect natural user input and refine intents
- **Pilot Testing:** Dialogue simulations with expected and edge-case user flows
